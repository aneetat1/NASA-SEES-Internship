        "### Plotting\n",
        "There are a few options for plotting in Python, but arguably the most complete plotting library is `matplotlib`.  The official documentation is rather intimidating, but there are some tutorials and helpful examples [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Arrays\n",
        "The unofficial standard for array manipulation in Python is the [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) package.  Arrays are like lists but have a fixed size.  Due to their fixed size in memory, computations with arrays can be much faster than looping over a list of numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dictionaries\n",
        "Dictionaries are also collections like lists, but they don't have a fixed order to the entries, and are indexed instead by arbitrary key values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### File input/output\n",
        "Python makes it easy to read and write text files. See the official docs [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classes and objects\n",
        "A class is a prototype of an object, and we've been using objects this whole time.  Objects have attributes, which can be the usual types we've talked about like floats and strings.  They can also have methods, like the `sort()` and `append()` functions shared by all lists.  Attributes are accessed using the \"dot\" notation, in that `object.attribute` is a reference to the attribute held by that particular object.  For more on writing your own classes, see [here](http://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Classes.html)."

        "* module - a script that can be imported into another script\n",
        "* package - a module or group of modules that are easily installed\n",
        "* Jupyter notebook - a browser-based environment for running programs, AKA an Ipython notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "### Programming terms\n",
        "* syntax - the set of rules that define a legal statement in a language\n",
        "* variable - a label for an object in the computer's memory\n",
        "* assignment - the act of storing a value in a variable\n",
        "* scope - for a particular variable, its scope refers to the parts of the code where its assignment is valid; it can be global to the whole script, or local to a particular function or class\n",
        "* binary operator - a function that takes two values and returns a new value, e.g., +, -, *, /\n",
        "* unary operator - a function that takes one value and returns a new value, e.g., -, not\n",
        "* loop - an evaluation of the same logic multiple times\n",
        "* conditional - a control statement that determines which of some possible statements will be evaluated\n",
        "* function - an object that can be called with some input values and can return some output values\n",
        "* class - a \"prototype\" of an object, e.g., `int` is a class, and 1, 2, and 3 are instances (or objects) of this class\n",
        "* object - an instance of a particular class; in Python, just about everything is some kind of object\n",
        "* method - a function associated with objects of a particular class; e.g., for the `list` class, the `sort()` function is a method of the class\n",
        "* object-oriented programming - a programming style that relies on organizing logic into classes of objects which can have their own attributes and functions\n",
        "* function programming - a programming style that only uses \"pure functions\" (that is, functions which do not have side effects, and only interact with the rest of the scope through their return values)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic variable types\n",
        "* string - a sequence of characters, e.g., \"Hello Python!\"\n",
        "* int - a type of numeric value, short for integer\n",
        "* float - a type of numeric value, short for floating point (an approximation of a real number)\n",
