        "There are a few options for plotting in Python, but arguably the most complete plotting library is `matplotlib`.  The official documentation is rather intimidating, but there are some tutorials and helpful examples [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Arrays\n",
        "The unofficial standard for array manipulation in Python is the [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) package.  Arrays are like lists but have a fixed size.  Due to their fixed size in memory, computations with arrays can be much faster than looping over a list of numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dictionaries\n",
        "Dictionaries are also collections like lists, but they don't have a fixed order to the entries, and are indexed instead by arbitrary key values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### File input/output\n",
        "Python makes it easy to read and write text files. See the official docs [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classes and objects\n",
        "A class is a prototype of an object, and we've been using objects this whole time.  Objects have attributes, which can be the usual types we've talked about like floats and strings.  They can also have methods, like the `sort()` and `append()` functions shared by all lists.  Attributes are accessed using the \"dot\" notation, in that `object.attribute` is a reference to the attribute held by that particular object.  For more on writing your own classes, see [here](http://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Classes.html)."
